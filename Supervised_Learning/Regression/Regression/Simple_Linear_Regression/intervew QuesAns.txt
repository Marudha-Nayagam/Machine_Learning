🔹 Basic Level:
Q1. What problem are you solving in this project?
👉 Predicting salary based on years of experience using Simple Linear Regression.

Q2. Why did you choose Simple Linear Regression?
👉 Because there is one independent variable and one dependent variable with a linear relationship.

Q3. What is the equation of Simple Linear Regression?
👉 y = mx + b

🔹 Medium Level

Q4. What does coef_ represent in your model?
👉 It represents the slope (weight), showing how much salary increases per year of experience.

Q5. What does intercept_ represent?
👉 It represents the base salary when years of experience is zero.

Q6. Why did you use train-test split?
👉 To evaluate model performance on unseen data and avoid overfitting.

Q7. Why did you use R² score?
👉 It explains how well the independent variable explains the variance in the dependent variable.

🔹 Advanced Level

Q8. Why did you use Pickle in this project?
👉 To save the trained model and reuse it later without retraining.

Q9. What happens if R² score is negative?
👉 It indicates the model performs worse than predicting the mean.

Q10. How would you improve this model?
👉

Add more relevant features
Handle outliers
Try Polynomial Regression
Increase dataset size


🔹 Coding-Based

Q11. Why should input be 2D in predict()?
👉 Scikit-learn expects input as a 2D array: (n_samples, n_features).

Q12. Why do we visualize the regression line?
👉 To understand the linear relationship and model fit visually.



4️⃣ Final Tip (Very Important 💡)

In interviews, explain like this 👇

“I built a Simple Linear Regression model to predict salary using years of experience, evaluated it using R² score, visualized the regression line, and deployed it by saving the model with Pickle for future predictions.”
